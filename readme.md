# My Jam Game

In this repo you can find the source code and other files of the game I was working on for the Arcade Game Jam. I didn't finish it and submissions close today so I'm not going to submit it. During the previous two weeks I had to switch to another project which is why I couldn't finish this one.

## Idea

The idea for the game was a puzzle game where there is a direct obvious solution and an indirect hidden one. The direct solution is harder, but it is possible to pass the level without finding the hidden solution. That's how I incorporated the theme of Loopholes.

## How to launch

The game is made with Godot Engine. You can download the project and open it with Godot Engine. The game is not finished, but you can play the levels that are there. The first one is finished and the second one is not.

## Notes

All the models and textures are made by me.

## License

The license it MIT. The project is fully open source. You can use the code and assets in any way you want. I would appreciate it if you mention me in the credits, but it's not necessary.
